| September 4 | 5:15-6:45 | I worked with niam on this project. I created a series of functions that determined whether or not the board was winnable. First I checked if there was a series of 6 snakes in a row and then if there was, if there was a ladder to bypass it. By using those functions we checked if the board was valid. |
